I logged into the file server, and after googling determined that I'd need to make changes to <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>.

This didn't work, so I initially thought it was a routing issue. However, other computers on the network were also unable to <code>ping 8.8.8.8</code> but still access the internet, so I next suspected it could be a DNS issue. I checked <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> on the backup server, and it pointed to <code>127.0.0.1</code>. I checked the same file on the file share server and it pointed to <code>172.16.30.5</code>, so I updated the backup resolv file.

I found that the <code>archive</code> folder was on the <code>Fileshare</code> server, and repeated the steps in the Windows Mounting Share section to enable it. I checked that it was available from Workstation-Desk, and performed the following commands from the Backup server.</p> <p><code>sudo mkdir /mnt/backups</code> <code>sudo mount -t cifs //172.16.30.32/archive /mnt/backups</code> This command did not initially work for me, giving me an invalid filesystem type error. I tried to install <code>cifs-utils</code> and <code>psmisc</code> as a mounting smb shares tutorial had indicated. This fixed that error, but I was still getting a <code>mount error(6): No such device or address</code>. It turned out that I had named everything the singular <code>archive</code> instead of the plural <code>archives</code>, so the smb server was trying to serve a nonexistent folder. After cleaning up <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>, I reran the updated command: <code>sudo mount -t cifs //172.16.30.32/archives /mnt/backups</code>, which ran without errors. I then ran <code>mount -t cifs</code> to verify that it was mounted and it was. Finally, responded to the ticket from Workstation-Desk and marked it resolved.\u00a0</p>"}]}
